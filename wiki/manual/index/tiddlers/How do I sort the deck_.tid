title: How do I sort the deck?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Sorting is done by dragging in the list of decks. When a card belongs to more than one deck that is being studied, the parameter of the previous deck is used first.

* When you are learning, the deck to which the card belongs is displayed on top of the card.
